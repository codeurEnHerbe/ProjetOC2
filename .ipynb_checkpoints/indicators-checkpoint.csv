It includes expenditure funded by transfers from international sources to government. Divide total government expenditure for a given level of education (ex. primary, secondary, or all levels combined) by the GDP, and multiply by 100. A higher percentage of GDP spent on education shows a higher government priority for education, but also a higher capacity of the government to raise revenues for public spending, in relation to the size of the country's economy. When interpreting this indicator however, one should keep in mind in some countries, the private sector and/or households may fund a higher proportion of total funding for education, thus making government expenditure appear lower than in other countries.

Net attendance rate is the total number of students in the theoretical age group for primary education attending that level, expressed as a percentage of the total population in that age group. The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) calculates household survey-based education indicators using data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS). School participation in household surveys and censuses is commonly measured by whether pupils or students attended a given grade or level of education at least one day during the academic reference year. Therefore, indicators of school participation derived from household survey data refer to attendance, e.g. “net attendance rate” or “adjusted net attendance rate”. The comparable indicator for administrative data is ""Net Enrolment Rate"" because the data is based on numbers of students officially enrolled in educational institutions in the stated year. Each poverty quintile represents one fifth of students with quintile 1 being the poorest 20 percent of students and quintile 5 being the richest 20 percent of students.

The indicator is based on UNESCO’s methodology, which estimates the proportion of children who will never attend school as the proportion of out of school for the age group with the lowest proportion of out-of-school children. This methodology assumes no dropout before the age at which enrolment rates peak, and no late entry after the age with peak enrolment.
